# senior_project

My senior project, a website for my middle school age neice that has started a custom baking business out of her kitchen, is available as a publicly accessible website at http://www.katescustomcakes.com.

When accessing the site, there are a number of pages available that allow visitors to view some of her prior work, get general pricing information (subject to change based on the complexities of the design) and a contact form to request additional information.

The site is hosted at GoDaddy and the business is able to manage the content on the site via the WordPress Content Management System, accessible on the site to authorized users at http://www.katescustomcakes.com/wp-admin/.

Other site controls, including DNS, email settings, database settings and other non-content related options is managed via the site's cPanel login, again accessible only to authorized users at http://www.katescustomcakes.com/cpanel/.
