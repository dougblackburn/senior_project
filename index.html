<h2>Overview of Project</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to design and develop an e-commerce enabled website.  My “customer” for this project is my 12-year old niece.  An aspiring baker, she has been baking cupcakes, cakes and other deserts for neighbors, her parents’ coworkers and others in the community.  She has been accepting orders via a Google webform and working with her on building a full e-commerce enabled storefront that allows her to demonstrate her capabilities, show off some of her prior works and allow potential customers to navigate, select items, choose preferences and provide specific instructions, and complete their order through a secure integrated payment gateway would be an excellent opportunity to demonstrate some of the many skills that I have learned over my 4+ years in the WeBSIT program.</p>
